Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Project: Local Password Manager

Version: 1.0 (Initial Draft)

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a local command-line password manager written in modern C++.
The system allows users to securely store, retrieve, and manage their passwords in an encrypted vault file protected by a master password.

1.2 Scope

The Password Manager will:

Run locally on a user’s computer (no network features in the initial version).
Provide a simple CLI interface for basic password operations.
Encrypt all stored data using strong cryptographic algorithms.


1.3 Intended Users

Individuals who want to securely manage passwords locally.
Developers of modern C++ and cryptographic programming concepts.

2. System Overview

The application is a command-line tool with three main components:

1. Vault Manager – handles loading, saving, and encrypting/decrypting the vault file.
2. Credential Manager – manages credential operations (add, list, get, delete).
3. CLI Interface – provides command-line interaction with the user.

Data is stored in a single encrypted file on disk, accessible only with the correct master password.

3. Functional Requirements

ID Requirement Description

FR-1 Create Vault The system shall allow the user to create a new vault protected by a master password.
FR-2 Open Vault The system shall prompt the user for the master password to unlock an existing vault.
FR-3 Add Credential The system shall allow the user to add a credential (service, username, password).
FR-4 List Credentials The system shall list all stored credentials (without showing passwords by default).
FR-5 Get Credential The system shall display the decrypted password for a selected service.
FR-6 Delete Credential The system shall remove a credential entry by service name.
FR-7 Save & Exit The system shall encrypt and save all data securely upon exit.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

ID Requirement Description

NFR-1 Usability The CLI shall provide clear commands and readable output.
NFR-2 Performance Loading or saving the vault shall take less than 2 seconds for up to 1000 credentials.
NFR-3 Portability The software shall compile and run on Linux and Windows.
NFR-4 Maintainability Code shall be modular, documented, and follow modern C++17+ best practices.
NFR-5 Reliability The vault file shall not be corrupted by abnormal termination or I/O errors.

---

5. Security Requirements

ID Requirement Description

SR-1 Basic Encryption All stored credentials must be encrypted before saving to disk. 
SR-2 Master Password The vault must be protected by a master password that is required to open it.
SR-3 Key Derivation (Simple) Derive an encryption key from the master password using a basic function.
SR-4 No Plaintext on Disk The vault file must never contain passwords or credentials in plain text.

---

6. Data Requirements

Vault File Format:

Header: metadata (version, salt, nonce, MAC).
Payload: encrypted JSON or binary data with credentials.


Credential Fields:

Service Name (string)
Username (string)
Password (encrypted string)


---

7. Command-Line Interface Requirements

Command Description Example

create Create a new vault pm create vault.dat
open Open existing vault pm open vault.dat
add Add a new credential pm add gmail user@gmail.com
list List all stored credentials pm list
get Retrieve credential password pm get gmail
delete Delete credential pm delete gmail
exit Save and exit vault pm exit

---

8. Future Enhancements (Optional)

Password generator (configurable strength and length).
Password strength validation.
Encrypted vault backup.
GUI interface (Qt).
Sync feature with remote server (future research).

---

9. Constraints

Must be developed in modern C++17 or later.
Must use CMake as the build system.
Must rely on libsodium or OpenSSL for encryption.

---

10. Acceptance Criteria

The program compiles and runs correctly.
A user can securely create, open, and manage credentials via CLI.
Vault file content remains unreadable without the correct master password.
All tests for encryption, saving, and loading pass successfully.
